# Live Coding Performance Practice

Live coding is a dynamic new way of performing music where performers type code and the code box in real time to generate audio and video. Much of live coding's popularity comes from the practice of *Algoraves* - dance parties where instead of DJ's there are coders shaping the music.

But there are lots of different ways of thinking about shaping music using code that aren't necessarily explicitly dance music based. What about traditional performance techniques? Integrating gestural controllers? Thinking about nuances of expression and how to represent those using code or using algorithms?

The Creativitas live coding website is one main output of the collaborative music lab. You can check out the website [here](ianhattwick.com/creativitas).
