## Getting Started with the Voxel synth table

The first thing you want to be able to do is get everything turned on and making sound - this isn't always easy! Here are the basic steps, and some tips along the way.

### Turning on the power

       Everything on the synth table, and the PA system as well, is powered through a single power strip. This is zip-tied to a pipe on the wall. Simply turn this strip on and everything will power up!
- you never need to turn anything on the table off
- in fact, it is bad practice to!

### Starting the clock

The table has a complex clock system to make sure everything plays together. Here is what you need to do to get clock running:


- set the drumBrute to MIDI sync mode
- turn on the superconductor
- press play on the superconductor. 
	- (Also change tempo here if you want)
- check the drumbrute starts playing along with the superconductor.

A note on the clocks:
- many devices use MIDI clock, generated by the superconductor and split using a headphone splitter and both 1/8" TRS cables and regular DIN-5 MIDI cables
- other devices need to use analog clock. This is generated by the DrumBrute, and output to the black jacks on the silver bus bars. The bus bars need to have cables connecting them all together (typically using the jacks on the ends.)

## Plugging in some synths


### Mother-32

The Mother-32 is a great starter synth. It's really flexible, sounds amazing, and is really musical to control. I typically use the Korg SQ-1, the little black sequencer. Here's a picture of how to patch it up so the sequence of controls the pitch and triggers notes.

### Korg MS-20

</div>

The Korg MS-20 is also really fun and a lot dirtier than the moog. It does require some sequencer settings that are different than all of the other synths, so make sure you use the SQ-1 that is labeled for use with the MS20. Look for the piece of tape on the front.

You can totally use the sequencer to control the pitch of the MS20. But since it has a keyboard, it's also fun to use the sequencer to control the lowpass filter instead. Here are examples of how to patch both of those up.

### Monolab

The Monolab is a brand new synth, and we just acquired a bunch of them for the library and for FaMLE. I'm going to try to keep one on the table from now on, but you can also check them out from the library beginning sometime next week. 

I forgot to take a good clean picture of the simplest set up, but basically it is similar to using it with the other synths. The pitch and gate input for the monolab are both on the very top left of the synth.
